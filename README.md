### Building documents manually

**If you did need to build the documentation**

Install `doxgen`. On a mac, that's `brew install doxygen`; other systems may differ.

Install sphinx and other requirements for building the docs:
```
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```

Run the build process:
```
sphinx-build -b html docs/source docs/build
```
